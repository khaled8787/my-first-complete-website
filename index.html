    <div class="khaled">My name is khaled mahmud (<i>date of birth 2004</i>). I live in sadar upazila of natore district. I am honours first year student.
    Every person has a specific dream or goal in life. Everyone works towards that goal and tries to spend all his energy to reach the goal. My goal in life is to be a good person to my family and keep them happy for the rest of my life. I am ready to spend all my energy to do this.</div>
    <br>
    In order to reach certain goals i have to follow some rules below:
    <br>
  <div class="time"> <ul>
    <li>Time work done on time.</li>
   </ul>
If time work is not done on time,it will be very difficult to reach my goal,so my first task is to value time.</div>
<br>
 <div class="try"><ul>
  <li>I have to try my best to follow the islamic restrictions.</li><br>

  <br>
 </ul>
